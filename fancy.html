		  	      <h3>Why the softwre in this guide is separated into two different archives</h3>
		  <P>As this is a question that is probably going to be asked a bunch of times, I will address this concern here.</p>
		  <p class="br">This software is separated into two archives:</p>
		  <ul class="txtli br">
		    <li><code>wiikit.zip</code></li>
		    <li><code>wiikit_ugly.zip</code></li>
		  </ul>
		  <p class="br"><code>wiikit.zip</code> provides the general tools for softmodding the console and preparing it for other tasks. After this point, you can do <i>anything you want</i> (within reason) to the console's software, leaving the responsibility up to you whether or not you begin to use the console as a device for infringing upon domestic and international copyright laws, (further) violate Nintendo's ToS / ToU / EULA and partake in software piracy.</p>
		  <p class="br">By downloading <code>wiikit_ugly.zip</code> and following related instruction shown here, it is implied you understand this software is, and <i>all</i> software / services in this guide are presented <b>as-is</b> with no express guarantee of efficacy and functionality, and the author of this guide is not held responsible for any legal trouble you may encounter in your use of the software if reported to local authorities, charged for software piracy and convicted for breach of copyright.
		  <h4>In plain speak:</h4>
		  <ol class="br">
		    <li>I do not know if this software will work for <i>your</i> particular console, despite my best efforts.</li>
			<li>You cannot extort money from me or file a lawsuit for following these instructions; you are performing these instructions yourself.</li>
			<li>I will not hold myself responsible for your abject stupidity, nor will I lose sleep at night knowing this information may incarcerate you and forever ruin your life.</li>
	      </ol>
		  <p>With this understanding, if you agree to the above, you are free to download this kit of software and use this guide's contents to engage in potentially criminal activities. If you are not comfortable with this, you can <i>still</i> follow all instructions which are less likely to toss you behind bars and ensure your Wii is given a second life via the efforts of hundreds who created awesome software for the console, including, but not limited to freely-downloadable games and ports of PC games for use on the console.</p>

          <p class="br">The Nintendo Wii isn't a hard unit to modify, and other guides are usually straight-forward about this topic. This will also walk you through other software that may be of interest to any user with a modified Nintendo Wii, so you can enjoy the full benefit of this process with enhancements to the console's functionality.</p>
          <p class="br">If for some reason you forgot your parental control code, there is a website which allows you to remove this code rather easily. If this happens to be the case, follow these steps:</p>
          <ol class="br">
            <li>Make sure the time and date on the Wii accurately reflects your console's time, relative to its timezone,</li>
            <li>Have the console know you forgot / don't know the console's parental control code.</li>
            <li>Visit <a href="https://wii.marcan.st/parental">this website</a> to input the confirmation code you would otherwise give to Nintendo.</li>
            <li>Use the unlock code that website gave you; this should help to unlock the Wii, should you not know its parental control code.</li>
          </ol> After following these steps, you are free to do whatever you please with the console, which in the case of this guide is to install third-party applications. </div>

            <div class="body end">
              <p class="br">For this method to work, you will need to obtain a special archive made <i>specifically</i> for your system. All you need is as follows:</p>
              <ul class="br">
                <li>An SD card 32GB or less</li>

              <p class="br">In order to begin with letterbomb, you need to find your console's Machine Access Code (MAC). To find your MAC, navigate to the following sections in order:</p>
              <ol class="br">
                <li>Wii Settings</li>
                <li>Internet (on page 2)</li>
                <li>Console Information</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="br">From there, you will see a series of six hexadecimal numbers: This is the number you need to input at <a href="https:/.please.hackmii.com">https:/.please.hackmii.com</a>. At that website, do the following:</p>
              <ol class="br">
                <li>Specify your console's region</li>
                <li>Input your console's MAC address</li>
                <li>Verify you are human, then click either of the submission buttons.</li>
                <li>Download, then extract the specially-crafted archive to the root of your Wii's SD card.</li>
                <li>Eject the SD card, then insert into the Wii.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>After the above, it is simply a matter of visiting the message board and if applicable, looking in yesterday's messages for a red envelope with a bomb inside. This will execute savezelda, which will forward you to the Homebrew Channel Installer.</p>

This is a trick question, and due to Dr. Clipper's previous actions with older versions of this installer I had to include the most recent version, as all telling <i>that version of</i> the software you're a pirate does is undo everything it did, forcing you to run the installer once again. </div>

			    <li>Load applications before <i>anything else</i>, aside from BootMii</li>

            <div class="body end">
              <p class="br">This utility allows you to transfer information from Gamecube memory cards to either SD card or attached USB media. For users with RVL-101 models of Nintendo Wii, this is a good way to transfer saves to's RVL-001 so Gamecube titles can be loaded via USB with NMM loading save data from file on the SD card.</p>
			  <p>It also has the facility to format memory cards, and export saves to RAW format should you prefer.</p>

			<div class="body end">
			  <p class="br">Nintendont is a USB loader for Gamecube. It can even permit the use of the Gamecube system menu, should one wish and allow for cheating, if enabled in Nintendont's settings. Along with just the program itself, the copy of Nintendont provided also brings with it a variety of themes for menus and when loading titles, so after configuring these settings the software will look more-or-less how you wish.</p>
			  <p>You may use Nintendont in conjunction with Dios Mios, a replacement MIOS for Gamecube if you wish however unlike Dios Mios, Nintendont won't break compatibility with Gamecube media should you choose to use Gamecube discs.

		  <a class="item option" id="6opt6"><h3>WiiFlow</h3></a> <!-- opt15 -->
		  <div class="nestins">
			<div class="body end">
			  <p class="br">WiiFlow is a USB loading utility with a coverflow-style menu. With an appearance inspired by Apple's iTunes which had CoverFlow and a variety of themes available via the Internet, WiiFlow can be modified to become a very personalized and elegant way of displaying your digital library. On top of being a USB loader for Wii and Gamecube titles (with the included build being specially optimized for use with Nintendont), it can act as a replacement or supplement for the following:</p>
			<ul class="br">
			  <li>The Homebrew Channel</li>
			  <li>Wii System Menu</li>
			  <li>Nintendont / Dios Mios</li>
			  <li>Various emulators via plugins</li>
			  <li>WiiRD (cheats database)</li>
			  <li>CleanRip (for copying games)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is a very useful utility, as seen from its capabilities to supplement or displace tools which you may otherwise need to obtain for copying and managing media. The only thing it cannot do is install WADs, but this is what HacksDen's Multi-Mod Manager is for. Using the items from <a href="https://dw-hb.github.io/wiihb/fancy.html?section=5#title5">section 5</a> as an example, you can install just about any WAD representative of WiiWare titles for loading those from system memory as well.

            <div class="warn msg bdr">This software <i>does not work</i> for Gamecube ISOs. There is another utility to shrink Gamecube games shown in the next option.</div>
			<div class="body end">
              <p class="br">This software is used to manage Nintendo Wii titles. While not entirely necessary to enjoy a Nintendo Wii title loaded from USB, it provides several key benefits:</p>
			  <ul class="br">
			    <li>Easier management of installed titles</li>
				<li>Handling of media on two separate devices (or locations)</li>
				<li>Conversion of titles into several formats</li>
		      </ul>
			  <p class="br">The last of the listed highlights is important to understand, as obtaining Wii titles from the Internet presently isn't as easy as Wii U and 3DS titles, which is subject to change in the near future. As we aren't there now, a suite of tools are required to use content from the Internet via USB media or SD card.</p>
			  <p>The WBFS format should be of interest for most people who are archiving <i>a lot</i> of titles as it features the main benefits of compact ISO (CIOS) while allowing the titles to be usable in <i>all</i> USB loaders. However, some software for PC requires the title to be of ISO format before changes can be made, which would decompress the image and return it to original file size.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="info msg bdr br">From observing features presented in this software, it appears like there is a possibility of using original media to make backups on PC, however not all optical devices are compatible which if this is the case for your PC, tools like CleanRip (not covered) or WiiFlow (from <code>wiikit_ugly.zip</code>) should be used on the Wii instead.</div>
			<div class="warn msg bdr"><i>Always</i> keep the original media you are modifying until confirming changes made do not render modified media unplayable. There is a distinct possibility some titles will not function at all and for the sake of saving a few megabytes for larger titles, the effort may not be worth it.</div>

          <div class="nestins">
		    <div class="warn msg bdr br">This is part of <code>wiikit_ugly.zip</code> because the act of patching using these tools can be considered as piracy <i>even if you own the original</i> without the effort of using a USB loader or dedicated software for creating an archive of the intended target. Even with the original copy, modifying games with these tools can still be considered violation of domestic and international copyright laws.</div>
			<div class="info msg bdr">This software only works on ISO files, and most may work even if they were scrubbed. Use Wii Backup Manager to convert WBFS to ISO.</div>
            <div class="body end">
              <p class="br">Being the most popular of the two WFC alternatives (the other, not covered being AltWFC), Wiimmfi (pronounced whim-fi) is very easy to implement into any WFC-compatible game. Below is a summary of the directories provided:</p>
			  <ul class="txtli br">
			    <li><code>ACCF</code>: Patcher designed specifically for Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City / City Folk.</li>
				<li><code>MKWii</code>: Patcher designed specifically for Mario Kart Wii.</li>
				<li><code>Generic</code>: Patcher for all other Wii WFC games, such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl or Bomberman Blast.</li>
				<li><code>WiiWare</code>: patcher for all WFC WiiWare titles, such as Uno or Tetris Party.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p class="br">The patchers provided can be used as follows: </p>
			  <ol class="br">
			    <li>Place compatible images inside of their respective directories.<ul>
				  <li class="txtli">If there are system-specific directories, place images in there, assume further instructions are followed there.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Run the patcher batch or shell file, respective for your operating system<ul class="txtli">
				  <li>If Windows SmartScreen warns about the file being potentially malicious, it isn't; Click on <code>More Info</code> and sselect <code>Run anyway</code></li>
				  <li>If on an open-source system or Mac, you may need to execute `chmod a+x` on the file before executing the shell script in terminal.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Collect the modified ISO image at the directory the script generates</li>
			  </ol>
			  <p>Once modified, you should be able to launch your game and use the WFC functionality it originally had, thus retaining the original value of the titles affected. For a full list of compatible titles before you begin modding, check out <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/stat?m=24">this compatibility list.</a></p>
            </div>
			<div class="info msg bdr">While there are a lot of "Compatible" titles, few ever garnered massive communities. Online experience may be worse for lesser-known titles, requiring a significant interest by the Wiimmfi community before fast matchmaking is a possibility.</div>
